This is the final project for team SpotTok. Our idea involves using the Spotify API which will have users be able to view
different songs and play the songs through the Spotify Application. We will utilize a 'settings' and 'liked songs' section
that is similar to what we covered in class. 

Liked songs:
The liked songs section will be similar to bookmarking songs. We will utilze a SQLite database to store the songs the user
likes/saves. 

Detail Songs:
We will allow users to browse the songs they like further by clicking on the liked songs to see a detailed version of 
Song name, artist, picture 

Settings:
Users can sort what genre they like based on the spotify API sorting features. If not, the settings page will mainly be used
as an extra page.

Main page:
Our main page will "shuffle" through the Spotify API's song choices. Users can swipe through different songs and like the songs
if they wish. The songs will be able to play/pause.
